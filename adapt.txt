Take $1 from PayPal and show ad

	Adapt is a advertising program. It has no bundling or messy data usage contracts. it can be a small shop keep's dream instrument. Or, a large corporation's media-outlet in communities where people are mostly outside of town; something they may be used to but cannot breach, except for television. It is convenient, clean, easy to use and will necessarily be automated on most fronts.

	Adapt will run on API devised for Android and iPhones. It can be drawn up with the Tables of the database sketched out above. We will do the programming ourselves. The only cost I can see is the domain name and hosting. This portion, which I ave in my life never done, needs to be clean, crisp and easy. I expect the cost to be about $50 a month to begin.

	The monetary income will not come from users. It will be an hourly fee to advertise. When a shopkeeper or store [client] sends out an ad, they [customers] will see the ad and click it out. I do not get part of the sales, but we get a fee for advertising. One fee per advertisement. A advertisement MAY fall under multiple categories. But the ad must be aimed at a target keyword that is in relief of the widget and its space, between the categorical icon, and the store icon. That fee is $1 an hour per advertisement. This means that if a company has a target that fits in multiple categories, then it will be paid $1 an hour, per advertisement; not per category. However, two separate ads are $1 each; whether in the same category or not.

	Text ads may be 250 characters long. The text ad will be searched for keywords. If it applies to more than one, and it applies to X separate contexts, the ad will run at $X an hour. The rule applies so that people do not advertise in more than one category on purpose with one ad, escaping the feature of the project. However, this rule may be exercised on purpose in order to shorten the ad making process. This allows for one ad to be in increase of customer eyes, but it does not deflate the bottom line with us.

	Video ads are to be equal to or under 15 seconds. Your mass message may be in video format. All videos will need to be on a video streaming service, properly embedded within HTML. Video is not a more costly avenue of media for Adapt. It is a more vibrant way to reach your users.

	All video rules apply to audio.

	Banner ads are images that are fitted into the context window (widget) on the layout of the phone's icon display. Their inclusion is below the tap of a contextual icon of category, and below the store-brand of which there is to be seen under these contextual icons. "Billy's Wine and Liquor" would be categorized under the Liquor/Alcohol icon. By clicking on "Billy's", the ads he has provided under the keywords for Liquor/Alcohol. This is his nook in the nesting of the program. But, optionally there should be a mode where context is gone, and store's are the higher nest. Then their ads are together. However, "Billy" may also have products like pop, or vitamin water, which fall under Beverages. So once in his nook under Beverages the second ad is there, if it is a separate ad. If it is the same ad, then the price goes to $1 each. In the second mode, where the client is topmost, then the context icons will be under the advertisement of the store. The each context is $1 for the first ad, and $1 after; each.

	Adapt also has the greatest deals on the internet available. If you need something, go, find it on the internet, and send it to your local store with our system. Once you've done this, it'll be in our system. It will then be able to be reordered in different or same quantities in our system. When others go out surfing for things, they will also be enabled to do the same with their orders. We will be mirroring many sites. So you'll be finding the best price for what you need or want.

	When a wishlist has been made, and the point of minimum orders has been reached, the order is brought up to the store owner who is making the list. He may wait as long as he/she wants which can go to the maximum orders. With limited ordering, the list will be as long as there are wishes for the item, but they will have a order number, which is first come, first serve on the phone app. All of this will have dialog on the website of our clients, as well.

/// *** 4/2/2019
	A store avatar will be used, be it a icon or a photo. The client will either upload, or use a predefined "standard" avatar. One may also have one purchased. This will cost the client up to $100 dollars. An icon, or avatar will be unecessary in the registration process, because it will become a standard icon/avatar. 

	With every thousand dollars we find in investment we will be getting an elite programmer to help our core development department with anything they might need. By arbitration we may gain insight to better fundamentals and not overly commit our shortlist of developers to writing code. We expect to bring the polished production program our company is opines in about 3-7 weeks.

	Being able to follow stores to create relationships with your favorite businesses is important. By taking them with you no matter where you are, you can search for items online and link these items to your favorite businesses. It's necessary for petitions to work. That makes it necessary for everyone to have input.

	When following stores in Cheri, you may wish to petition for a group event, items that you'll need in surplus. You may do this by creating a New Petition and pin the links for your items to it. The store manager will have a panel on the app that will allow the him/her to approve or decline. The petition status will be updated accordingly as: pending, approved, declined, ordered, delivered. There will be a delivery date set on all that are ordered which the client has entered. Groups in Cheri have the most power with petitions. As well as single users asking for when things have come in, groups have what I spoke.
